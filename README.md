🚀 RFM Customer Segmentation using Weighted RFM Z-Score

Completed an end-to-end customer segmentation analytics project on the Olist E-Commerce Dataset, where I designed a robust RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model using SQL, enhanced with Z-score normalization and weighted scoring to generate actionable business insights.

🔍 Project Highlights

Built RFM metrics using optimized SQL Views & CTEs

Applied Z-score normalization to reduce skewness in Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values

Designed a Weighted RFM Score:

Recency: 40%

Frequency: 30%

Monetary: 30%

Segmented customers into:

🏆 Champions

💎 Loyal Customers

🌱 Potential Loyalists

⚠️ At-Risk

❌ Lost Customers

Identified high-value revenue drivers and churn-risk customer groups

📈 Business Impact

This data-driven segmentation enables businesses to:

Improve customer retention strategies

Run targeted marketing campaigns

Maximize customer lifetime value (CLV)

Reduce churn with proactive insights
